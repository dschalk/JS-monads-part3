#JS-monads-part2
 
This is the third page of the `Javascript Monads` series.  

The project's running code is at [http://schalk.net](http://schalk.net). You can run the binary on port 3093 by entering `dist/build/server/server`. The monads and functions demonstrated here are in a script, so you can press F12 and experiment with them in the console.
